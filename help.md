# We're here to help!
#### Some questions you might like to know the answer to.

## Who can see my status?
Only people you have added as a friend!

## How do I add a friend?
Friends can only be added through the app by scanning their unique code. Open Lunch Box and tap the **+** button in the bottom right corner. This will open your camera. Have your friend do the same and then tap the QR Code button at the bottom right of the camera screen. Look at this code through your phone and you and your friend will be connected.

## How do I remove a friend?
Tap on the status of the friend you want to remove. Then tap "remove friend" from the action sheet that appears. You can always re-add a friend later.

## What should I put in my status?
My friends and I find it helpful to list the name of the place we're interesting in going to, such as our favorite burger joint "🍔 Meatheads", or to share what you plan to do such as "🥪 Packing my Lunch". It can also be helpful to set your status to "🚫 Unavailable" or "🏝 On Vacation" if you're not available or out of town. Your status can be whatever you want though, so have fun with it!

## What is my "Display Name"
Simply put your display name is the name shown on your status. Make it something helpful or recognizable so your friends know who it is.
